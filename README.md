# ansible

***Under Construction***

The goal of ansible is to provide secure peer to peer file sharing without the need for a cloud storage intermediary.

All files are hosted on a users machine and transferred directly via by the user's ISP.

This is accomplished by serving a containerized Flask application from the user's machine. 

The application exposes a chosen directory and sub-directories to the world while preventing clients from breaking out of the directory. File interaction features are under construction.
