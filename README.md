# ansible
peer to peer file sharing with a web interface

***Under Construction***

The goal of ansible is to provide secure peer to peer file sharing without the need for a cloud storage intermediary.

All files are hosted on a users machine and transfered directly via by the user's isp.

This is acomplished by running a micro-server within a Docker container on the user's machine.
